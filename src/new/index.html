                Data-based decision-making systems are increasingly affecting people‚Äôs lives. Such systems decide whose
                credit loan application is approved, who is invited for a job interview and who is accepted into
                university.
                This raises the difficult question of how to design these systems, so that they are compatible with
                fairness
                and justice norms. Clearly, this is not simply a technical question - the design of such systems
                requires an
                understanding of the social context of these applications and requires us to think about philosophical
                questions.

                Over the past few years, the adoption of AI models has skyrocketed, and more decisions have been taken
                by
                such algorithms. Machine learning models provide good prediction results, but the predictions may not be
                interpretable most of the time. The wide adoption of such models and the decisions that already directly
                impact our lives and their use have led to rising concerns about the fairness and trustworthiness of
                such

                including AI, within a Human Rights Framework. An important aspect of the study was conducted around the
                ethics of AI. Ethics in AI represents guarding against certain kinds of discrimination and, if possible,
                encoding the abstract concept of fairness into the system. Even if we are trying to capture, encode and
                program such guards into the trained models, other complex data patterns might capture the bias and make
                it
                invisible to such guards. A fair dataset will produce fair models, but the machine learning models are
                only
                as good as the data they are trained on: ‚Äùbias in, bias out‚Äù.

            <h3>Counterfactuals in XAI</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                In the field of XAI, counterfactuals provide interpretations to reveal what changes would be necessary
                in
                order to receive the desired prediction, rather than an explanation to understand why the current
                situation
                had a certain prediction. Counterfactuals help the user understand what features need to be changed in
                order
                to achieve a certain outcome and thus infer which features influence the model the most. Counterfactual
                instances can be found by iterative perturbing of the input features until the desired prediction or a
                prediction different than the original outcome is obtained.
                We focus on searching for a counterfactual solution in the input space to capture an unfair decision on
                the
                part of the model and mitigate bias or simply emphasize a wrong decision-making behavior caused by a bad
                data structure.

            <h3>Counterfactuals in XAI</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                By using counterfactual explanations we prove and overcome the fragility and bias of a machine learning
                model. The scope of the research is to reduce the bias toward a specific feature or a set of features in
                the training dataset to increase the model fairness without altering the correlation value between the
                rest of the features on the outcome.
                Counterfactuals can be used as unit tests to measure the fragility of the model. Using the MNIST example
                a poorly trained model would have a reduced number of changes for a different outcome than the original,
                as opposed to a model that is trained well that will introduce more noise in the generated image.

                The counterfactuals were generated using seven iterations,
                each consisting of a batch of 1,000 samples for measurements
                and counterfactuals. The decrease of accepted solutions with
                each iteration results from an increase in model
                robustness and a proof that the generating algorithm finds
                fewer solutions or the found solutions have too many changes
                to be accepted. To evaluate the model fairness update, a benchmark dataset
                was used after each new batch of synthetic data was pushed
                back into the training dataset, and the model was updated.
                After each benchmark, we extracted the number of times
                each feature was changed for both generated and accepted
                solutions. For the initial iteration, Gender was the primary
                feature that was changed to generate a potential solution (696
                potential solutions, 302 passing the threshold). As the model is
                updated and the fairness is corrected, later iterations observed
                a decrease in solutions with changes in Gender and mainly
                focused on other, more relevant to the real-world features, such
                as Age, Education Num and Hours per Week.

                We computed the correlation matrix between each input
                feature against the output column (Salary Status) to monitor
                the influence of each feature on the outcome at the training
                dataset level. As shown in the figure below, the Gender feature influence
                on the outcome was highly diminished without significantly
                impacting the rest of the features. There are also other features
                that capture a personal characteristic, such as race, but since
                the original training data was not biased toward race, the
                feature importance of this column was not changed at the
                end of the iterative process. Also, features that do not contain
                any personal characteristic (e.g. Occupation, Hours per Week,
                Education) suffered a minor change at the end of the iterative
                process thus maintaining the original data characteristics.
